    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **“objects”**. The object contains both data and code: Data in the form of properties (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of methods (actions object can perform).\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* attributes\n",
    "* behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A parrot is can be an object,as it has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* name, age, color as attributes\n",
    "* singing, dancing as behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",

    "### Class \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, everything is an object. A class is a blueprint for the object. To create an object we require a model or plan or blueprint which is nothing but class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class represents the properties (attribute) and action (behavior) of the object. Properties represent variables, and actions are represented by the methods. Hence class contains both variables and methods.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of class as a sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot. Here, a parrot is an object.\n",

    "* **Documentation string:** represent a description of the class. It is optional.\n",
    "* **class_suite:** class suite contains component statements, variables, methods, functions, attributes.\n",
